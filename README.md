Twitter ADA!

Let's build a Twitter replica! Your program must have at least three features:

* 1 - Registration of new users

* 2 - Login of registered users

* 3 - Post a tweet on the timeline

* 4 - View tweets already posted on the timeline

Note one: tweets must contain the author of the tweet and the date on which it was published.

Note two: It is not necessary to connect to any type of database, everything will be done in memory.
